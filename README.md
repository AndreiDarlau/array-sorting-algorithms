# Sorting Algorithm for Integer Arrays

We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

## Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

## Radix Sort

Radix Sort algorithm is a stable sorting subroutine-based integer sorting algorithm. 

The algorithm is implemented in C.
